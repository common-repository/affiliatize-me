Make all your links affiliate links.

== Description ==
This plugin searches links on your site for the domain that you specify in the settings, adds your affiliate ID, and makes those links open in a new tab when clicked.

The plugin produces XHTML Strict compliant code and is search engine optimized (SEO).
This is done using JavaScript's `window.open()`-function. It adds only a few lines of vanilla JavaScript to the page, and does not require any external libraries like jQuery.

Most other plugins perform a hack by altering the `target` parameter (i.e. `<a href="http://somewhere.example" target="_blank">`). That method is not XHTML Strict compliant.

This plugin handles the links client-side, which lets search engines follow the links properly. Also, if a browser does not support JavaScript, the plugin is simply inactive, and does not result in any errors.


**Credits**
Inspired by the [External Links in New Window / New Tab](https://wordpress.org/plugins/open-external-links-in-a-new-window/) plugin.

**Known bugs**
The plugin conflicts with other plugins that change the links' `onClickÂ´ attribute.
